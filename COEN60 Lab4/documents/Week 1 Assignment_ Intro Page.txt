Hi Professor Kratz,


        My name is Evan and I am a current sophomore majoring in Web Design and Computer Engineering. Part of the reason why I selected this major was because I was stuck choosing between engineering and learning about communication through technology, so I am especially excited to take this class in the morning! I took COMM2 last school year and was shocked on how little knowledge I knew about the world such as how our world today is controlled by a few oligarchy. It was also interesting to see how Facebook and Google are slowly implementing themselves, or already have, everywhere in the world. As a result, I am hoping that I can learn more about the way we communicate through social media in this class in order to gain a better perspective on whether or not our society is improving through technology. 
        On a side note, here is a little about me. I grew up in the bay area (Sunnyvale, CA) and have always loved it here, which is why I chose to attend a school near home. During my free time, I love to get active with activities such as basketball, golf, and swimming. When I’m not doing activities, I am a major addict to electronics, which I feel like our generation has become accustomed to. I either sit back and watch Netflix, play games on PS4, or check social media on my smartphone. Recently, I started getting into creating my own music, so I am hoping to release my first album at the end of the school year.
        I look forward to having another amazing quarter and learning more about the most integral part of our daily lives: technology and communication!


Sincerely,
Evan Chou
