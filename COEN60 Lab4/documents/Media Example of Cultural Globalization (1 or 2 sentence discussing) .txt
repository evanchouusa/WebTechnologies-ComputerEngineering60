Media Example of Cultural Globalization
        A media example of cultural globalization is Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). KFC is a fast food chain that can now be found in mostly all countries worldwide and reflects the American culture of fried food. However, through globalization, the fast food chain has also incorporated and adopted different countries’ cultures depending on their location. For instance, in Japan, the KFC’s sell biscuits that look like donuts and Kentucky Fried Rice Bowls. Japanese people also have a tradition of buying KFC to celebrate Christmas.
