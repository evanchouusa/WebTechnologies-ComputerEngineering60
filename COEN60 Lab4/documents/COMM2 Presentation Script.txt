* Ok, so I will be talking about newspapers and culture, specifically the importance of newspapers and the effect of newspapers on different cultures.
* As social media platforms are slowly taking the world, there has obviously been a decrease in the usage of newspapers.
   * We see this in that image there, with only 16% of the American population getting news from newspapers, with the rest getting news from the television or social media. 
   * Which raises the question of how newspapers are still surviving?
* Bringing us to the main point: Because it has been embedded in our culture and serves as an important medium for understanding the world 
* For instance, the image on the right shows topics such as crime and politics for which newspapers are the top source.
   * Adults, specifically, rely on the newspaper for topics such as Crime and politics over more modern sources, including the television or more so social media.
* In another source I found, 48% of those who get information about taxes turn to newspapers, more than double the percentage who turn to the next most popular platforms, the internet (20%) and TV news (19%). 
* It’s because of these 4 criteria that newspapers are still relevant in our society
* Now, out of these 4 criteria, the last criteria is the most important because social media also meets the first 3 criteria, but newspapers offer universality: it covers a range of topics and offers a wide range of information, even if each subject or story has limited audience
* As we talked about with our guest speaker a couple of weeks ago, there are search engines and algorithms that allow us to personalise the news to our own priorities and interests.
* So here is an example of my own Facebook. I’m a sports guy and Facebook knows this, so my feed is filled with news on sports. Definitely, not into politics, so I rarely see any news on that subject. Therefore, I’m not getting the variety of news I would see on a newspaper.
* And now I’m going to jump into the cultural importance of newspapers.
* In Latin/South America, newspaper reading represent a form of cultural expression and participation of particular importance for traditional, historical and cultural reasons, potentially enabling significant crossovers at societal level.
* They believe that newspaper reading not only benefits students in their subjects but also improve the general knowledge and knowledge of culture and trends in various parts of the country.
* In North America, elderly people living in the cities use newspaper as a part of life. They are newspaper learners from childhood. It helps them to understand how people, societies, countries are doing in today’s time.
   * There’s a quote on the handout that shows how elderly people feel about newspapers.
* Research shows that 81% of the elderly read newspapers, so unfortunately we might revert back to reading newspapers when we grow old.
* Finally, job seekers can see various new jobs and employment opportunity in the newspaper. Often private companies and government department, recruitment agencies use newspaper a primary source for job advertisements and news. That’s why it’s important for job seekers to remain updated about the current government and private sector job opportunities.
* In India, almost all shopkeepers and offices are regular users of the newspaper. The newspaper helps shopkeepers, business owners, entrepreneurs to understand the current economic trends, market prices, new laws and government policies and festival dates. So they can prepare the stock and understand demand and supply.
* They also use newspapers to package small items such as milk packet, spices and various other things.
* Weekly special pages of Hindi English newspaper helps housewives to learn about new cooking recipes. Such as Amar Ujala Hindi newspaper publish cooking recipes, sweet making tips etc. content that really excites housewives to try and implement the recipes.
