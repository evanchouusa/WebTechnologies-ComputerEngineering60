Discussion Questions
1. If television has focused on covering weather, traffic, and breaking news, and that is what people look to this platform for, will television begin to cover taxes and zoning and education if the local newspaper no longer exists? 
2. Would new digital sources emerge to cover the hole if a local newspaper cut back its coverage or vanished altogether? And would the approach of these new sources be fully journalistic in nature?
3. Why do people trust social media news more than actual newspapers? What makes social media news reliable?
4. How do newspaper companies keep up with technology?
